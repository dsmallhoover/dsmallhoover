- 👋 Hi, I’m David
- 🏗️ I'm currently attending a coding bootcamp and will graduate in December 2022.
- 👀 I’m interested in... creating something new everyday; reality tv shows; sports; coffee; learning to code.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and working on a text-based golf game.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple, fun, and goofy projects.
